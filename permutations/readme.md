This is an exercise to develope a method for testing
two strings to see if they are permutations of one another.

I started with what was essentially a sort method using built
in array methods. This led me to build a proper sort method out
of curiosity. However, I did not build a permutations tester out of it.

It also made me realize, I did not need to sort anything, I could just blow
it up as I went. So I build a destructive tester, deleting matches as I went
and compared the leftovers.
