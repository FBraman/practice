This is some ruby practice from a problem I found in a book. It was nice to do some straight forward problem solving. It was also good to get more familiar with datastructures.
The idea was to come up with a simple string compressions method. So that characters would be compressed to that character followed by a number representing that character's occurences. 

So that ...

string = 'aabecddd'  

def compress(string)
 code
end
   ...would return a2becd3 for compression. 

Fun so far, but not done.
	-handling for numbers and decompression are unaddressed.
